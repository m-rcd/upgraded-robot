A command line program that takes in commands and moves one or more robots around Mars.
(The name of this project was generated by github but was a fun coincidence!)

## Requirements

- The world is modelled as a grid with size m x n
- The program reads the input, updates the robots, and prints out the final states
of the robots
- Each robot has a position (x, y), and an orientation (N, E, S, W)
- Each robot can move forward one space (F), rotate left by 90 degrees (L), or rotate
right by 90 degrees (R)
- If a robot moves off the grid, it is marked as ‘lost’ and its last valid grid position and
orientation is recorded

## Technologies

- Ruby 
- Rspec

## Usage

1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:m-rcd/upgraded_robot.git
cd upgraded_robot
```

2. Run the script 
```shell
./bin/run.rb './input_1.txt'
```

Input:
```
4 8  
(2, 3, E) LFRFF 
(0, 2, N) FFLFRFF
```

Output: 
```
(4, 4, E) 
(0, 4. W) LOST
```

## Testing

To run specs

```shell
bundle exec rpsec spec/
```

## Further Development 

- Add validations: absence of argument in command should fail before reaching InputParser, presence of coordinates and action in input
- Add dependency injections
